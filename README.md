# Day 1 of Origin Code Academy:
## Calculate how much you'd weight on other Solar Bodies

This is a simple calculator using:
- HTML
- CSS (with Purecss.io)
- Javascript

Error validation is involved- no non-numbers can be entered, nor negative ones.
An extra is that when a user calculates their weight, an image of the solar body they're checking their weight on is showed using a master object of each solar body, meaning other celestial bodies can be added easily.
